    "  - Parity bits help detect and correct a **single-bit error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encoding Example:**  \n",
    "  - Original message: `[1, 0, 1, 1]` (4 bits)  \n",
    "  - `encode()` adds parity bits → `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` (7 bits)  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **How decoding works:**  \n",
    "  1. Suppose during transmission one bit flips by mistake: `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]`  \n",
    "  2. `decode()` calculates **syndrome** using the `H` matrix.  \n",
    "     - Syndrome is a 3-bit vector that indicates **where the error is**.  \n",
    "     - Example: syndrome = `(0, 1, 0)` → tells error is in **bit 2**.  \n",
    "  3. Use `SYNDROME_TO_POS` → flip the wrong bit → `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`  \n",
